        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to know how to reduce stress, art is the way to go!By expressing your creative side, it will allow you to get in touch with your feelings.When you paint, try to poor all your feelings out onto your art work. Putting your emotions down on paper will prevent yourself from taking whatever you feel out on others.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if your not very artistic, art is still a way to relax. Art is also a good way to let go of anything holding you back so all your emotions will leave you. It can also be a hobby for you, so you can also have a balanced lifestyle, as well as reducing stress.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to use the act of art to reduce stress is to have a sketchbook used as a jounal, but with drawings instead of words. Have multiple diaries of different things like: a dream diary and a diary of what is beautiful in life. You can also try coloring books as well because they can relax your mind.
